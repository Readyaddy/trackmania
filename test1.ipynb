    "COMPETITION TUTORIAL #1: Custom model and RL algorithm\n",
    "==============================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will customize the TrackMania training pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial works with the TrackMania FULL Gymnasium environment.\n",
    "Please refer to the README on GitHub to set up this environment in config.json:\n",
    "https://github.com/trackmania-rl/tmrl#full-environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This tutorial describes implementing and running a TrainingAgent along with an ActorModule.\n",
    "It is relevant if you want to implement your own RL approaches in TrackMania.\n",
    "If you plan to try non-RL approaches instead, this is also accepted in the competition:\n",
    "just use the Gymnasium Full environment and do whatever you need,\n",
    "then, wrap your trained policy in an ActorModule, and submit your entry :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy and adapt this script to implement your own algorithm/model in TrackMania.\n",
    "Then, use the script as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch the Server, provided the script is named custom_actor_module.py, execute:\n",
    "python custom_actor_module.py --server\n",
    "\n",
    "In another terminal, launch the Trainer:\n",
    "python custom_actor_module.py --trainer\n",
    "\n",
    "And in yet another terminal, launch a RolloutWorker:\n",
    "python custom_actor_module.py --worker\n",
    "\n",
    "You can launch these in any order, but we recommend server, then trainer, then worker.\n",
    "If you are running everything on the same machine, your trainer may consume all your resource,\n",
    "resulting in your worker struggling to collect samples in a timely fashion.\n",
    "If your worker crazily warns you about time-steps timing out, this is probably the issue.\n",
    "The best way of using TMRL with TrackMania is to have your worker(s) and trainer on separate machines.\n",
    "The server can run on either of these machines, or yet another machine that both can reach via network.\n",
    "Achieving this is easy (and is also kind of the whole point of the TMRL framework).\n",
    "Just adapt config.json (or this script) to your network configuration.\n",
    "In particular, you will want to set the following in the TMRL config.json file of all your machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"LOCALHOST_WORKER\": false,\n",
    "\"LOCALHOST_TRAINER\": false,\n",
    "\"PUBLIC_IP_SERVER\": \"<ip.of.the.server>\",\n",
    "\"PORT\": <port of the server (usually requires port forwarding if accessed via the Internet)>,\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are training over the Internet, please read the security instructions on the TMRL GitHub page.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Set a custom 'RUN_NAME' in config.json, otherwise this script will not work.\n",
